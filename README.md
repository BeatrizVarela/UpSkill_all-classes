# INTRODUCTION

The [UpSkill - Digital Skills & Jobs Programme](https://upskill.pt/) is the
result of a partnership between the [Instituto do Emprego e Formação Profissional](https://www.iefp.pt/),
the [Conselho Coordenador dos Institutos Superiores Politécnicos](https://ccisp.pt/pt/inicio/) and the [Associação Portuguesa para o Desenvolvimento das Comunicações](https://www.apdc.pt/).

This initiative is part of the [Digital Transition Action Plan](https://eportugal.gov.pt/noticias/governo-lanca-plano-de-acao-para-a-transicao-digital), approved in April 2020,
and its main goal is to respond to the needs of companies with qualified
resources in digital technologies. In addition, the UpSkill programme offers
unemployed candidates the opportunity to have the necessary knowledge to start
a new career.

The Programme consists of 6 months of intensive training in specific areas of
information and communication technologies, followed by 3 months of on-the-job
training in one of the participating companies.
