    "Pandas is a newer package built on top of NumPy, and provides an efficient implementation of a ``DataFrame``.\n",
    "``DataFrame``s are essentially multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels, and often with heterogeneous types and/or missing data.\n",
    "As well as offering a convenient storage interface for labeled data, Pandas implements a number of powerful data operations familiar to users of both database frameworks and spreadsheet programs.\n",

    "We will use examples drawn from real datasets where appropriate, but these examples are not necessarily the focus."

    "Installation of Pandas on your system requires NumPy to be installed, and if building the library from source, requires the appropriate tools to compile the C and Cython sources on which Pandas is built.\n",
    "Details on this installation can be found in the [Pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/).\n",
    "If you followed the advice outlined in the [Preface](00.00-Preface.ipynb) and used the Anaconda stack, you already have Pandas installed.\n",
