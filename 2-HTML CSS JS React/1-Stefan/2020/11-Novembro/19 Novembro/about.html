                <br>
                <br>
                I am a queer artist from Swansea, now residing in London, UK. I studied English Literature at University of Bristol, 
                and after reading the greatest works of literature in the English language I went on to work in the lowest medium of 
                all: webcomics.
                <br>
                <br>
                I began my first webcomic- Dorris McComics. This was an experimental series where I tried to see what I could do with 
                short form comics, often breaking the form and trying out different styles of punchlines. I then made two webcomic 
                series for LINE Webtoon- How to Love (a comic-format agony aunt series) and Hello World (a photo collage travel series).
                <br>
                <br>
                Webcomic Name was launched in 2016.
